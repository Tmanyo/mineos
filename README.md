GUI Computer Mod for Minetest

Note for Collaborators:

Goals:
 - Make basic application features uniform (Top right "-- Maximize X")
 - Make code as efficient as possible (My code that I have been throwing together is not very efficient, but I am going to fix that.)
 - Create realistic, neat, and user friendly applications.
 - I am going to change the structure of the files. (I am going to split the code into different files, instead of bunched up in init.lua.)
 - Each application will have it's own file. (Dofile must be added to init.lua so that the application is ran.)

To-do list:
 - Add more features to email.
 - Add a software center to make it possible/easier for third party applications.
 - Clean up code.
